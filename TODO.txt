# TODO
- External control and reading status through named pipe (fifo)
- AI module (maybe reinforcement learning or something else)

# TOTHINK
- Think about new rocket engine design (angle + power | 2 bodies, force to second + rotation | joint)
- Think about waiting 3-5 sec before green light
- Add dist to wings (to fix the bug when all velocity stops by wing, and landing is ok)
